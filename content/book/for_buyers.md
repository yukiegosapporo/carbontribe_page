**Market Trading**  
NFTs can be bought, sold, and traded across multiple platforms, offering liquidity and value to organizations seeking to enhance their carbon accounting.

**Carbon Offsetting**  
For those looking to offset their carbon footprint, NFTs can be burned to permanently retire the associated digital assets.

Once an NFT is burned, Carbontribe issues a verified Carbon Offset Certificate, providing proof of the retired credits for corporate reporting, regulatory compliance, or sustainability commitments.


With blockchain security and transparent verification, Carbontribe NFTs offer a seamless and credible way to engage in the carbon economy üåç.
