You can choose from two formats:  

✅ NFT – A tradeable digital asset that can be sold on marketplaces, enabling others to offset their emissions.  
✅ PDF Certificate – A non-tradable document containing a retired NFT hash, ensuring your carbon offset is permanently verified.  

Both options provide transparency and verifiable impact in the carbon market. 🌍🚀
