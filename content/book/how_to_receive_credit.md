# How to receive our credits?  

You can choose from two formats, each offering transparency and verifiable impact:   
✅ __NFT Credit__ – A tradeable digital asset that can be sold on marketplaces, allowing others to offset their emissions. This option provides flexibility and market liquidity.  
✅ __PDF Certificate__ – A non-tradable document that includes the hash of a retired NFT, ensuring your carbon offset is permanently recorded and cannot be resold.  
Both formats guarantee authenticity, security, and full traceability in the carbon market. 🌍🔗
