# Methodologies

At CarbonTribe, we believe that real climate action starts with integrity and scientific rigor. That’s why our methodologies are built on internationally recognized guidelines, ensuring that every credit represents a verifiable and measurable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  
Our methodologies are developed in alignment with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, the global benchmark for climate science. We rely on scientifically proven data and industry best practices to ensure that our projects deliver real, long-term impact.  
To uphold the highest standards of credibility, we have partnered with Earthood, a leading independent verification body. Earthood has thoroughly reviewed and approved our methodologies, confirming that they meet the strictest scientific and ethical standards.  

If you’d like to explore our individual methodologies and standards in more detail, visit their dedicated pages. There, you’ll find the full methodology, along with example projects showcasing their real-world impact.
