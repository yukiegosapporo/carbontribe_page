# The Environmental Crisis  

The world is facing an unprecedented environmental crisis. Greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), are at an all-time high, leading to rising global temperatures and damage to ecosystems. Deforestation, industrial pollution, and unsustainable agricultural practices further exacerbate the problem, pushing our planet to its limits.  
Despite international efforts, emissions continue to rise, and the transition to a low-carbon economy is not happening fast enough. Without immediate, effective, and transparent action, we risk irreversible damage to our planet and the well-being of future generations.  



# The Issues in the Carbon Market  

While carbon markets were created as a solution to help offset emissions and drive investment into sustainable projects, they are plagued by inefficiencies and ethical concerns:  
❌ **Lack of Transparency** – The carbon credit market is often opaque, making it difficult for buyers to verify the quality and effectiveness of the credits they purchase.  
❌ **Questionable Impact** – Some projects that generate carbon credits fail to deliver real, measurable emission reductions.  
❌ **Complexity and Inaccessibility** – The current system is highly technical, filled with regulatory hurdles, and difficult for businesses and individuals to navigate and participate.  
❌ **Greenwashing** – While carbon credits can be a valuable tool for offsetting emissions, their effectiveness is often questioned when they are used to mask unsustainable practices rather than drive real reductions.  
❌ **Small and medium-sized projects are excluded** – High startup costs and fees make launching a carbon credit project inaccessible, shutting out the majority of impactful, socially beneficial initiatives worldwide.
