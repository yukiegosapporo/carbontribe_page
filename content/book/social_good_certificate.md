# Social Good Certificate ü§ù

When you purchase a Carbontribe credit and complete your payment, a new challenge begins: transparently distributing the funds to project developers and local communities.

We track the money flow, and upon a successful transfer, we issue a Social Good Certificate, powered by NFT technology. This certificate securely stores transaction data with signatures from both ends, ensuring full transparency.

As a buyer, you receive both the original Carbontribe credit and the Social Good Certificate, verifying your contribution to environmental and social impact.
