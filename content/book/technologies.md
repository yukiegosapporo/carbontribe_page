# Carbontribeâ€™s Technology

Carbontribe leverages cutting-edge digital technologies to transform carbon sequestration and emissions reduction. Through the integration of satellite imagery, computer vision, machine learning, and blockchain, we provide precise, scalable, and transparent monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for carbon credits. This innovative approach ensures accuracy, scalability, and trust in the measurement and management of carbon removal efforts.

####  AI-based dMRV  
Our dMRV (Digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) system utilizes satellite and computer vision technology to provide both real-time and historical analysis of land usage and green indices from anywhere on the planet. Our satellite-driven approach enables cost-effective, high-accuracy monitoring of vast landscapes. By utilizing multiple resolution levels, spectral data, and frequent updates, we provide detailed land classification and vegetation tracking. Our computer vision model further enhances this process by automating land cover classification and environmental monitoring, achieving high accuracy.  
####  Science-based Methodologies    
Our methodologies are built on established, approved guidelines, and are thoughtfully crafted to ensure precision and reliability. Additionally, our standards are rigorously validated through a third-party audit. By combining scientific principles with cutting-edge technology, we ensure a robust and trustworthy approach to environmental monitoring and carbon credit management.  
####  Web3-based Data Management  
We securely store all relevant data on the blockchain, ensuring transparent, tamper-resistant records that support scientific reproducibility. Carbon credits are issued as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) linked to immutable metadata on the decentralized InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), ensuring full traceability and fraud prevention. This blockchain-based approach simplifies ownership transfers, credit retirements, and replaces fragmented registries with a unified, tamper-proof system. By combining these technologies, Carbontribe offers a reliable, scalable solution for tracking carbon storage, ensuring environmental integrity, and fostering trust in the carbon market.
