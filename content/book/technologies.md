# Carbontribeâ€™s Technology

Carbontribe leverages cutting-edge digital technologies to transform carbon sequestration and emissions reduction. Through the integration of satellite imagery, computer vision, machine learning, and blockchain, we provide precise, scalable, and transparent monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for carbon credits. This innovative approach ensures accuracy, scalability, and trust in the measurement and management of carbon removal efforts.

####  AI-based dMRV  
Our dMRV (Digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) system utilizes satellite and computer vision technology to provide both real-time and historical analysis of land usage and green indices from anywhere on the planet. Our satellite-driven approach enables cost-effective, high-accuracy monitoring of vast landscapes. By utilizing multiple resolution levels, spectral data, and frequent updates, we provide detailed land classification and vegetation tracking. Our computer vision model further enhances this process by automating land cover classification and environmental monitoring, achieving high accuracy.
