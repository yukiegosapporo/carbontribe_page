# What is an NFT and why does Carbontribe issue NFT credits?

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are one-of-a-kind digital assets stored on a blockchain, guaranteeing authenticity, ownership, and transparency. Unlike traditional carbon credits, NFT-based credits are tamper-proof, ensuring that each carbon offset is unique and verifiable, preventing double-counting. By tokenizing carbon credits as NFTs, Carbontribe creates a system where carbon offsets can be traded, verified, and retired with ease, making the entire process more efficient and trustworthy. 
Key benefits of Carbontribe’s NFT model:  


✅ Prevents Double-Counting  
Each NFT represents a unique, verifiable carbon credit, ensuring one-time ownership and eliminating duplication.  


✅ Single Source of Truth  
Carbontribe shares all the metadata and information linked to each NFT, enabling global auditability and transparency.  


✅ Full Transparency  
Blockchain technology tracks credit issuance, trading, and retirement, making the carbon offset process publicly auditable.  


✅ Global & Fractional Access  
NFTs enable small-scale participation and simplified trading on decentralized marketplaces, broadening market access.  


✅ Automated Retirement  
Smart contracts ensure that carbon credits are automatically retired upon use, delivering real impact without delays.  
 
✅ Increased Liquidity  
NFT-based carbon credits can be bought, sold, and retired more efficiently, improving market efficiency and accessibility.
