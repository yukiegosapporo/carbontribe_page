# Where does my money go?

In the traditional carbon credit market, project developers often receive only a small fraction of the funds raised from credit sales. This is due to multiple layers of intermediaries, each imposing various fees:    
- __Registration Fees__ – Costs associated with enrolling projects in a registry.  
- __Processing Fees__ – Charges for validating and listing carbon credits.  
- __Third-Party Audit & Consultation Fees__ – Expenses for external verifiers and consultants assessing project credibility.  
- __Transaction & Brokerage Fees__ – Additional costs from brokers or middlemen facilitating sales.  
These accumulated fees reduce the financial support that reaches the actual project proponents, limiting their ability to scale initiatives and create meaningful impact.
