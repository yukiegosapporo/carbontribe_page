# We’re Officially Earthood Certified!

After an extensive and thorough review process, we’re proud to announce that our methodologies have been officially certified by Earthood, a globally recognized independent verification body.

This certification validates the scientific rigor and real-world impact of our work across:

Green forest restoration

Mangrove regeneration

Agricultural emissions reduction

In addition to the approval of these individual methodologies, we’re especially proud that our Common Methodology, the foundation for all our work, has also been reviewed and approved. This core document outlines our unified approach to data collection, validation, and impact tracking across all ecosystems and project types.

Our methodologies are not only aligned with global best practices, but they are also transparently implemented through our Web3-based system, ensuring open, auditable, and science-based climate action.

## Breaking it Down 


As part of the final validation process of Carbontribe’s methodologies and frameworks, Earthood undertook a thorough review using a wide array of internationally recognized guidelines, frameworks, and technical references. These documents ensure the methodological integrity and alignment of Carbontribe’s practices with globally accepted standards in greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting, remote sensing, and sustainability.

Earthood’s review drew upon the following cornerstone documents and frameworks:



**IPCC Guidelines and Supplements:**

- 2003 IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
- 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
- 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for Wetlands
- 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines

**Remote Sensing and Accuracy Assessment:**

- 2014 Good Practices for Estimating Area and Assessing Accuracy of Land Change – Offers statistical methods for evaluating land use changes.
- National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS) – Used to assess satellite imagery resolution and interpretability, essential for spatial accuracy in land cover classification.
- European Space Agency: Newcomers Earth Observation Guide – Offers foundational remote sensing principles and satellite data usage guidance.
- Carbon Market and Sustainability Standards:
- Core Carbon Principles by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) – Benchmarks for high-integrity carbon credits.
- UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – Ensures alignment with relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially those related to climate action, life on land, and partnerships for goals.

**Advanced Computational Techniques:**

- Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (2016) – Referenced for integrating machine learning and AI-based classification techniques, crucial for scalable MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) systems

## Where We Go From Here

Now that our methodologies are Earthood-certified, we’re entering the next phase: implementation and scaling with confidence. This milestone not only enables us to launch new projects under a verified framework: it also provides the scientific validation and market security that our ongoing projects deserve!

For methodologies that were not part of this Earthood review, we are actively exploring additional pathways for validation to ensure they evolve with the same level of rigor. Continuous learning, transparency, and improvement remain core to our mission. With our AI-powered monitoring and blockchain-based infrastructure, we’ll keep expanding into new ecosystems, refining our tools with live field data, and inviting open auditability, so that every credit issued can be trusted by anyone, anywhere.
