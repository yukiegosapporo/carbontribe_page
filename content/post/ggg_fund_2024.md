Exciting News! 🌿🌍 
Thrilled to announce that Carbontribe Labs has received strategic investment from Greenway Grid Global (a TEPCO group CVC, the 4th largest utility power company globally). We're partnering to conduct forest analysis PoC in Southeast Asia, specifically in Indonesia and Vietnam, using Carbontribe's technology for extensive analysis covering over 100,000 hectares. Together, we aim to achieve high-quality, transparent carbon credit generation through computer vision analysis for Regenerative Economy. Stay tuned for our environmental impact! 🌳💚
