Our Moretrees - Nara Prefecture Reforestation Project is a collaborative, community-led initiative focused on restoring native broadleaf forests in Japan's Kii Mountain range. This area was historically shaped by forestry, but is now facing ecological and economic decline due to reduced timber demand, aging populations, and increasing wildlife pressure. Many such plantations have been clear-cut and left without viable plans or funding for regeneration. 

The project aims to regenerate biodiversity and ecological function by planting (over 2000!) native trees such as Phellodendron amurense and Quercus crispula. These species are well-adapted to the regionâ€™s climate and support greater biodiversity and soil health than commercial monocultures. This effort restores ecological integrity to a landscape previously impacted by commercial forestry, while enhancing long-term carbon sequestration, soil stability, and habitat diversity. Owned and supported by the local community and forestry cooperative, the project emphasizes transparent stakeholder engagement and long-term stewardship.

This project not only improves long-term carbon sequestration capacity, but also rebuilds ecosystem resilience and community engagement. Although small in scale, the project serves as a replicable model for post-harvest forest landscapes across Japan.
