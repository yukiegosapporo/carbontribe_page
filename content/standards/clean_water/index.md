Ocean debris poses a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human livelihoods. Each year, millions of tons of waste, including plastics, metals, and other materials, enter aquatic environments, disrupting marine and freshwater systems. This debris not only harms wildlife through entanglement and ingestion but also contributes to the degradation of habitats and the contamination of water resources. The persistence of these materials in the environment exacerbates global challenges related to pollution, climate change, and ecosystem health.

This Methodology on Ocean Debris projects provides a comprehensive framework for projects focused on the collection and sustainable disposal of debris from aquatic environments, including oceans, deep-sea zones, coastal areas, rivers, and lakes. This methodology aims to address the pressing issue of man-made waste materials—such as plastics, metals, glass, and textiles—that harm ecosystems and biodiversity.
