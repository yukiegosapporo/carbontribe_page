Renewable energy is a cornerstone of global efforts to combat climate change and transition to a sustainable future. By replacing fossil fuel-based power generation, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which is the leading driver of global warming. In addition to mitigating climate impacts, renewable energy enhances energy security and fosters economic growth by creating resilient, decentralized energy systems.

This methodology guides projects in quantifying and verifying emission reductions from renewable energy initiatives. It ensures rigorous data collection, verification, and accounting to generate credible carbon offsets while advancing renewable energy adoption and climate solutions.
