Since the mid-20th century, global forests have faced significant declines due to deforestation, land-use changes, and other human-driven activities. These disturbances have resulted in the loss of vast forested areas, diminishing their ability to act as natural carbon sinks and exacerbating the challenges of climate change. Efforts to reverse these trends, particularly through afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR), offer a practical and impactful strategy for restoring degraded ecosystems and enhancing their carbon sequestration potential. However, the success of ARR projects depends on the careful selection of species, restoration techniques, and the re-establishment of ecological conditions conducive to forest growth.

This document presents a comprehensive methodology for ARR-based projects, providing a systematic approach to quantifying and verifying CO₂ sequestration. It is designed to guide the restoration and conservation of forest ecosystems, addressing the degradation caused by human activity. Forests are among the most significant natural carbon reservoirs, storing substantial amounts of carbon in their biomass and soils. Given their critical role in climate regulation, precise and scientifically validated methodologies are essential to ensure the accuracy and credibility of carbon sequestration estimates from ARR projects.
The methodologies outlined in this document draw upon the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the 2019 Refinement, which provide internationally recognized frameworks for forest carbon accounting. Building upon these principles, this approach incorporates innovative tools and techniques tailored to the specific requirements of forest restoration. By combining robust scientific methods with adaptive, technology-driven solutions, this methodology ensures reliable carbon accounting while promoting global best practices in climate mitigation and forest ecosystem restoration.
