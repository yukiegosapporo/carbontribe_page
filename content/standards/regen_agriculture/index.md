Nitrogen-based fertilizers are vital for modern agriculture but pose significant environmental challenges, particularly through the emission of nitrous oxide (N₂O), a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 300 times that of carbon dioxide over a century. Overuse of these fertilizers not only exacerbates N₂O emissions but also degrades soil health and disrupts ecosystems. Reducing their application presents a critical opportunity to mitigate climate change while fostering sustainable agricultural practices.

This chapter examines Carbontribe’s methodology for mitigating N₂O emissions by optimizing fertilizer use, emphasizing the rigorous quantification and validation of emission reductions. Building on the foundational principles outlined in Chapter 1, it provides a specialized framework tailored to reducing agricultural emissions.
